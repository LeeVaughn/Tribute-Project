# Tribute-Project
<p>An expanded version of my Build a Tribute Page project for freeCodeCamp.</p>
<p>The project was initially completed in Codepen using only HTML and Bootstrap. You can view the original version here: https://codepen.io/Alebeard/pen/qPaWQN</p>
<p>Additional HTML has been added to account for things like meta data and stylesheet links that are built into the CodePen editor. Other changes reorganizing of container classes, remove of break elements, additional CSS styling, and new targets for the various links.<p>
