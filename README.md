# Tribute-Project
An expanded version of my Build a Tribute Page project for freeCodeCamp.
The project was initially completed in Codepen using only HTML and Bootstrap. You can view the original version here: https://codepen.io/Alebeard/pen/qPaWQN
Changes I would like to make:
-add basic HTML coding and links that are not included in CodePen code
-remove break elements and replace them with CSS styling
-rename elements and classes to improve clarity of code
