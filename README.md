# Tribute-Project
An expanded version of my Build a Tribute Page project for freeCodeCamp.
The project was initially completed in Codepen using only HTML and Bootstrap. You can view the original version here: https://codepen.io/Alebeard/pen/qPaWQN
Changes include reorganizing of container classes, remove of break elements, additional CSS styling, and new targets for the various links.
