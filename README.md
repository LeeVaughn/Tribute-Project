# Tribute-Project
An expanded version of my Build a Tribute Page project for freeCodeCamp.
The project was initially completed in Codepen using only HTML and Bootstrap. You can view the original version here: https://codepen.io/Alebeard/pen/qPaWQN
The expanded version will include all of the HMTL necessary to create a viewable website, cleaning up of the HTML to better meet best practices,
as well as additional CSS elements to improve the styling.
