                        <strong>This is the evolution of the band known as Tenacious D:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>1985 </b>- Jack Black and Kyle Gass meet for the first time while both are members of the theatre
                            troupe, The Actor’s Gang. There is initially animosity between the two as Gass feels that Black
                            is a threat to his role as main musician for the troupe.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>1989 </b>- Black and Gass become friends after a trip to Edinburgh, Scotland. A deal is struck
                            in which Gass will teach Black to play guitar in exchange for food from Jack in the Box.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>1994 </b>- Black and Gass write their first song together entitled “Melissa” after Black is dumped
                            by his girlfriend. Later that year, Black and Gass write their second song together inspired
                            by Metallica’s “One”, which Black says is the “best song in the world”. The duo spends three
                            full days crafting “Tribute”, a comedic song that will help evolve their comedy music persona.
                            Their first concert is at Al’s Bar and consists of the band playing one song, “Tribute”. They
                            give the audience a chance to vote for the band’s name by choosing between several options. The
                            name Tenacious D does not receive the majority of the votes but the duo forces it through anyway.
                            Tenacious D records four songs and releases their first demo tape entitled
                            <em>Tenacious Demo</em>.

                            produced only the first one is airs due to creative differences between the band and HBO.</li>
